# MPC

Model Predictive Control development for BFMC.

## Description

This project utilizes Gazebo model information alongside an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) from the ROS package robot_localization. It takes a predetermined waypoint list as input, planning and simulating the input commands required to traverse the path as quickly and accurately as possible. Simulations can be conducted either within Gazebo or independently.

## Structure

- **config**: Contains EKF parameters and instructions on how to reset them during simulation.
- **include**: Houses packages and functions required by MPC.
- **launch**: Contains launch files for MPC.
- **scripts** and **src**: Programs necessary to run MPC and display simulation results.

## Dependencies

### ROS
#### Installation:
http://www.autolabor.com.cn/book/ROSTutorials/chapter1/12-roskai-fa-gong-ju-an-zhuang/124-an-zhuang-ros.html

### robot_localization
#### Installation:

1. Install it as follows:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ros-noetic-robot-localization
    ```

### Acados

#### Installation:

1. Clone the Acados repository and navigate into it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/acados/acados.git
    cd acados
    git submodule update --recursive --init
    ```

2. Create a build directory, navigate into it and run cmake:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DACADOS_WITH_QPOASES=ON -DACADOS_EXAMPLES=ON -DHPIPM_TARGET=GENERIC -DBLASFEO_TARGET=ARMV8A_ARM_CORTEX_A57
    # Note: Replace ARMV8A_ARM_CORTEX_A57 with your device's architecture or use GENERIC if unsure.
    ```

3. Update the Makefile:
    ```bash
    # Set the following in <acados_root_folder>/Makefile.rule
    BLASFEO_TARGET = ARMV8A_ARM_CORTEX_A57
    ACADOS_WITH_QPOASES = 1
    ```

4. Build and install Acados:
    ```bash
    make -j4
    sudo make install -j4
    cd ..
    make shared_library
    ```

5. Install Python interface for Acados:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -e /home/{your user name}/acados/interfaces/acados_template
    ```

6. Update your `.bashrc` and source it:
    ```bash
    echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/home/{your user name}/acados/lib"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR="/home/{your user name}/acados"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

7. If you encounter issues with `t_renderer`, compile it natively:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/acados/tera_renderer.git
    cd tera_renderer
    cargo build --verbose --release
    # Replace the file <acados_root_dir>/bin/t_renderer with the one compiled natively i.e. <tera_renderer_dir>/target/release/t_renderer
    ```

### Other Stuff
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev
    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
    ```

## Running the Example

### Acados Simulation

1. Run the following command to execute the MPC simulation:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/mpc_acados.py
    ```

2. Upon successful execution, a GIF illustrating the simulation will be saved in `scripts/gifs_acados`.

### Gazebo Simulation

#### In Python
##### Path Following
1. Start the gazebo simulation:
    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch sim_pkgs map_with_car.launch
    ```

2. Start the ekf node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch mpc ekf.launch
    ```
3. Start the control node:
    ```bash
    rosrun mpc control_node2.py --useEkf 
    ```

##### Follow Traffic Rules
1. Start the gazebo simulation:
    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch sim_pkgs map_with_some_objects.launch
    ```

2. Start the ekf node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch mpc ekf.launch
    ```
3. Start the object detctor node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch control signFastest.launch show:=true print:=true
    ```
3. Start the control node:
    ```bash
    rosrun mpc control_node2.py --useEkf --sign
    ```

#### In C++
##### Path Following
1. Start the gazebo simulation:
    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch sim_pkgs map2023.launch
    ```

2. Start the ekf node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch mpc ekf.launch
    ```
3. Start the control node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch mpc controller.launch ekf:=true
    ```
4. If ekf set to false, we use the ground truth from gazebo to get the vehicle pose. In this case, no need to launch the ekf node.

##### Follow Traffic Rules
1. Start the gazebo simulation:
    ```bash
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch sim_pkgs map2023objects.launch
    ```

2. Start the ekf node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch mpc ekf.launch
    ```
3. Start the object detctor node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch control signFastest.launch show:=true print:=true
    ```
3. Start the control node:
    ```bash
    roslaunch mpc controller.launch ekf:=true sign:=true
    ```
